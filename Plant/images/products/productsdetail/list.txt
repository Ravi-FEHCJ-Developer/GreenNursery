Apple Trees

Cherry Trees

Quince Trees
Bumper crops of large yellow quince can be expected from this variety. Vranja quince have excellent flavour and fragrance. Often used to enhance apple pies, quince can also be used in jams, jellies and marmalades.
Soft pink flowers in April and large rounded leaves with drooping branches and good autumn yellow colour make this a very attractive garden tree. The RHS has recognised this Quince variety with the Award of Garden Merit.
The full latin name of this popular variety is Cydonia oblonga Vranja Nenadovic! A bit of a tongue twister so it's commonly just called Vranja but we know some customers like to check the full nomenclature.
